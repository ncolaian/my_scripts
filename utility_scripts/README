Description of the scripts that I have created that was not for any particular project

reverse_dna_file.pl:
	This script takes a fasta file and returns a file in the same directory	with every sequence reverse complimented

pre_mult_align_seq_flip.pl:
	This script should be performed on a dna file before aligning. It uses my master aligner to ensure that the sequences in the file are in the correct orientation. The sequences are assumed to already be closely related since it is a pre-alignment file. Becomes important when running muscle since an incorrect orientation can mess up the alignment produced.

updated_unifrac_pipeline:
	This script runs a pipeline originally created by Scott Yourstone. The script will perform a full unifrac analysis on a fasta file. It will make otus, filter out contaminants, provides a manual filter option, build an MSA, builds a phylogeny, runs unifrac, calculates pcoa, and runs alphadiversity.
